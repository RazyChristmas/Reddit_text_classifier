Lucky for him he bought at just the right time and bitcoin skyrocketed! He's a millionaire! Ben has come to me asking for help, again. He has been receiving a massive outpouring of financial advice from his friends and family, and he needs a quick way to decide what is actual financial advice and what is not.\n",

       "I'm a broke college kid, and with all the travel costs dropping due to corona virus this seems like a once in a lifetime opportunity to get some cheap traveling in. Do you guys know of any good deals on vacations or travel destinations? I'm open to anywhere but I'd prefer outside the USA.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1\n",

       "My girlfriend and I will both be graduating college soon and have been searching for a area to move to once we have some finances in order. We are from a small-town in SE Ky but with our political and religious beliefs, this isn’t the place where we can happily settle down. We have looked at surrounding cities within a few hours drive for family purposes, with only Lexington and Nashville really drawing our attention. We are willing to move anywhere across the US and will be making a decent salary between the both of us. However, places like Austin, Tx and most of California seem to have property and rent prices that are a little higher than we would prefer. We are just exploring options of somewhat reasonably priced locations that will be a place we can happily raise a family. Thanks for any replies in advance       1\n",
       "ISP service varies greatly. Even in the same US city it will be depend on your address and who services it.\\n\\nIf you have multiple options you generally don't need too crazy of a speed. 50 Mbps will be just fine for gaming, streaming, working from home with multiple people in the house. An individual would be fine with 30 and that's if you wanted 4K streaming from Netflix.\\n\\nIf your ISP for example offers 100, 500, and 1000 there is really little reason to go above 100. It's a big YMMV, but don't let a sales person talk you into insane speeds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",
